Fonts
No custom fonts are used - the app relies on the default system font stack provided by the browser (typically sans-serif).

The font sizing is controlled by:

Default base styles from /src/styles/theme.css
Tailwind text size classes: text-lg, text-xl, text-2xl, text-5xl, text-8xl, and text-[12rem] (custom size)



Answer card- color gradients
The gradient color effect on the answer side of the card is created using Tailwind CSS gradient utility classes. Here's how it works:

The Gradient Classes
<div className="bg-gradient-to-br from-indigo-500 to-purple-600">
Breaking it down:

bg-gradient-to-br - This sets up a gradient background that flows from the top-left to the bottom-right (br = bottom-right)

Other direction options: bg-gradient-to-r (right), bg-gradient-to-t (top), bg-gradient-to-bl (bottom-left), etc.
from-indigo-500 - This defines the starting color of the gradient (indigo-500)

to-purple-600 - This defines the ending color of the gradient (purple-600)

How It Works
Tailwind automatically creates a smooth color transition between the two colors, going diagonally from top-left (indigo) to bottom-right (purple).

Other Gradients in the App
The same technique is used elsewhere:

Background: bg-gradient-to-br from-indigo-50 to-purple-50 (very subtle light gradient)
Progress bar: bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-500 to-purple-600 (left to right gradient)
You can customize this by changing the direction (to-br, to-r, to-l, etc.) or the colors (from-X and to-X)!
